🎮 Rock–Paper–Scissors: Blockchain Beef Settler
🔥 The Concept
A fast, arcade-style Rock–Paper–Scissors game on the blockchain where players can:
- Settle beefs → Prove victories transparently with results stored on-chain.
- Climb the ranks → Compete in a ranked mode with ELO-style scoring.
- Earn NFT rewards → Winning streaks mint collectible NFTs with rarity scaling by streak length.
- Have fun → Flashy visuals, sounds, and a leaderboard that feels like an arcade machine.
🕹️ Gameplay Flow
1. Challenge
   - Player creates a match (or joins one).
   - They “commit” their move (rock/paper/scissors) secretly using commit–reveal.
2. Reveal
   - Both players reveal their moves.
   - Flashy animations (hands slamming down ✊ ✋ ✌️).
   - Sound effects: drumroll → victory cheer or sad trombone.
3. Result
   - Winner gets +1 score.
   - Result saved to the public beef log (anyone can view the history).
4. Ranking & Rewards
   - ELO ranking for competitive play.
   - Win streaks = NFT rewards (e.g.
     - 3 wins → Common Badge
     - 10 wins → Rare Trophy
     - 25 wins → Legendary Crown).
📊 Features
- Arcade-style frontend → Animated hands, neon scoreboard, retro sounds.
- Beef Log → On-chain history of matches, transparent & permanent.
- Ranked Leaderboard → Seasonal resets keep competition alive.
- NFT Rewards → Unique streak collectibles, tradable on marketplaces.
⚙️ Tech Stack
- Smart Contracts: Solidity + Hardhat (commit–reveal RPS, leaderboard, NFT minting).
- Frontend: React + Tailwind + Framer Motion (animations) + Howler.js (sounds).
- Blockchain: Ethereum testnet / Polygon (cheap gas for hackathon).
- Wallet Integration: MetaMask via Wagmi/RainbowKit.
🚀 Hackathon MVP (3 Days)
- Day 1: Smart contract (commit–reveal, beef log, streak tracker, NFT basics).
- Day 2: Frontend MVP (wallet login, play a match, see beef log).
- Day 3: Add visuals (animations, sounds), polish leaderboard, demo script.
🎯 Why It Stands Out
- Most hackathon dApps are flat + boring.
- This one is a game with sounds, animations, and social rivalry.
- The blockchain twist (beef log + NFTs) makes it a true Web3 project.
- Fun, memorable, and demo-friendly — judges can literally “settle beefs” live.
